# Hacky_Racer_Transponder
This project details how to build a Hacky Racer Transponder thats compatible with the i-Laps timing gate system that we use.  This work is based on the work previously done by RaceFPV/CoreIR, but the code has been simplified and reduced to target a single hardware standard (Arduino Pro Micro 32u4, 5v, 16MHz board). 

The electronic circuit has been amended from the original to include a new resistor connected to the base leg of the transistor, this resistor limits the high current that would otherwise be pulled through the Arduino Pro Micro straight to ground every time the transistor is pulsed ON. In addition to the new resistor the IR LED current limiting resistor value has been changed from 9.1 ohms to 47 ohms to reflect the specifications of the high power TSAL6400 IR Emitter LEDs used in this design. The new circuit also includes twin IR emmitters and an external Red flashing LED to show when power is applied.  

The Pro Micro development board used for this project can handle an input voltage of 5 - 12v DC at its RAW input pin (do not connect this input voltage directly to the VCC pin), the development board will reduce the input voltage applied at the RAW pin down to a steady constant 5v at the VCC pin, this fixed 5v is then used to supply the LEDs which are in turn switched via the 2N222a NPN transistor thats controlled by the Pro Micro microcontroller.
