# Hacky_Racer_Transponder
This project is for a Hacky Racer Transponder thats compatible with i-Laps timing gate that we use.  This work is based on the work previously done by RaceFPV/CoreIR, but the code has been greatly simplified for the specifid Hacky Racer use case and the hardware implementation has also been corrected and improved.
