# Hacky_Racer_Transponder
This project details how to build a Hacky Racer Transponder thats compatible with the i-Laps timing gate system that we use.  This work is based on the work previously done by RaceFPV/CoreIR, but the code has been greatly reduced and simplified and now targets a a single specific hardware standard (Arduino Pro Micro 32u4, 5v, 16MHz board). 

The electronic circuit for the hardware implementation has been corrected to include a new resistor connected to the base leg of the transistor, this resistor limits the high current that would otherwise be pulled straight to ground through the Arduino Pro Micro each time the transistor is pulsed ON and eventually cause damage to the microcontroller. In addition to the new resistor the IR LED current limiting resistor value has been changed from 9.1 ohms to 47 ohms to reflect the requirements and specifications of the high power TSAL6400 IR Emitter LEDs used in this design. The circuit also now includes twin IR emmitters and an external Red flashing LED to show when power has been applied.
